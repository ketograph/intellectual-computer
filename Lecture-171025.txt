does not work:
:alarm :pair : par1int1, par2int1.
:par1Int1:min __.

PARAMETERS VALUES
- Seperatly: we already have that in the KB
- simultaneously: we have to write that
  - just use a lot of pairs? but the intervals have to have distinct names
   :Alarm :pair :pair1.
   :pair1 :par1  _Int1-v2_;
        :par2  __;

SELECT ?State
WHERE
{
}


RULES
-> Form -> A-->B
-> example -> (500<=par1 <= 1000) --> alarm
             (------A------------)    (--B--)


next Task:
* represent tables of Lab1 with multiple values in KB
* also represent them in Arduino
* also we should show if it was caused by single/serperate parameter or by combined parameter
