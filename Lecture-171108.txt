differental equation (1st/2nd order)
transfer function (F(w)=1/(w+1)

scenario control
* we want to keep some parameters in a range and regulate
* this is issued to some specific equipment
* we have a set of parameters P1...P5
* normal scenario control SC0
  + we can create some graphs for that
    - standard graph y=f(x)
    - special graphs: continual graph
                      sequence graph
  + rules describtion (this works normal if this rule is obeyed)
    if par1 == x then par2==y --> but this does not consider time, so we have to find contorl find moments
      valve           pump
    define at which time we control some parameter (for t1 if... then...)
* Scenario 1 SC1
  + name (should tell me the most important details about scenario e.g. pump is broken
  + reason (pump broken)
  + consequences

1) describe normal scenario (SC0) and understand it
2) create different scenarios SC.. (name, reason, consequences), how many we would like
3) how to describe reason and consequences: 
   reason: some normal rules are broken
